# GO's structures

### for

In GO there is only the for loop, and with it you can create everyloop structure of other languages (while, do .. while).

### forMid.go

In GO the first and the last part of the for declaration are optional, so you can left them black.

### while.go

In GO you can do the while by using the for loop, without the first and the last part of the declaration, and also the semilcons

### if.go 

The if structure is similar at the for.

### ifStatement.go

The if structure can have a statemant inside it declaration.

### ifElse.go 

Like other languages the if has also the else.
