# GO func (funcitons)

Functions in go

### add.go

Example for understand go funcitons, just add to numbers.

### swap.go

Swap 2 strings given as arguments

### vars.go

Variables in GO, default values.

### varsInit.go

Variables in GO with initialization.

### varsInitShort.go

Variables in GO with short initalization (`:=`).

### nakedReturn.go

Return variables declared in func declaration for short functions.

### values.go

Function values

Function are values too. They can be passed around just like other values.

Function values may be used as function arguments and return values.

### closures.go

Function closures

Go functions may be closures. A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables; in this sense the funciton is "bound" to the variables.

For example, the `adder` function returns a closure. Each closure is bound to its own `sum` variable.
